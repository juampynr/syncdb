# Drush syncdb plugin

This project implements <a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/importing-huge-databases-faster" title="Lullabot article">two Drush commands to export and import large Drupal 7 or 8 databases faster</a>. 
It does it by splitting tables into separate files and importing them afterwards in parallel.

Here is a description of each command:

  * `drush dumpdb` dumps database tables into the temporary directory of
  the current environment.
  * `drush syncdb @example.dev` downloads sql files from `@example.dev` and
  installs them in the current environment.
  * `drush importdb --dump-dir=/foo/bar` imports all `*.sql` files from
  `/foo/bar` using the same method as `syncdb`.

There is no .module nor .info files because this is not a module. It is a Drush
command. Drush can find commands in certain directories such as `$HOME/.drush/`
or `sites/all/drush`. Run `drush topic docs-commands` on a terminal to see other
places where this project can be placed so Drush can discover it. Depending on
your needs you may decide to leave this command with or without your project's
versioned code.

## Requirements

* Drush: version 6 or higher.
* Drupal 7 or Drupal 8.
* Database: it has been tested just on MySQL.

It highly recommended that you install [GNU-parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel)
in the machine(s) that contain the data that you want to import. On Ubuntu, run
`sudo apt-get install parallel`. On Mac, run `brew install parallel`. This is not
a hard requirement, though. `drush syncdb` will still be able to import tables
witout GNU-parallel, but it will take longer to complete.

## Installation

Go to your project's root directory and run the following command:

```
composer require juampynr/syncdb
```

This will normally download the command into `/path-to-drush/drush/commands/syncdb`.
If you want to move it somewhere within your project so it is under version control,
move it to sites/all/drush or run drush dl --destination=sites/all/drush syncdb.

Next, log into the remote server which will server as the source from which
the team will download tables into their local environments. Install the command
there.

## Usage

You should set up a periodic job that runs `drush dumpdb` at the remote environment
that is designated as the source. This would normally be the Development
environment. This can be set up through [crontab](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto)
or [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/). Here is how you can set this up in crontab:

```
drush @example.dev ssh
crontab -e
# Paste the following command at the bottom of the opened file:
30 2 * * * drush --root=/path/to/your/drupalroot --quiet dumpdb --structure-tables-key=common
```

Once this job is set up, run it once in the remote environment so it will export
tables into, for example, `/tmp/syncdb-tables`. Now you can import these tables
into your local environment with the following command:

```
drush syncdb @example.dev
```

## Customizing the command

You can use the `--structure-tables-key` option in the same way it works for the
`sql-sync` command. This option will export structure tables into a file
called `structure.sql`.

If you install `parallel`, have a look at is options by reading the contents of the
command `man parallel`. There could be ways for you to optimize the command even
further.

## Usage examples
Here are a few screenshots of a terminal session using these two commands:
